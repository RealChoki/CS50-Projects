Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO
comparing million to 10. Portugal had a 14% chance of winning but with only 10 simulations it was not even in the list. Switzerland had 20% chance and that got halfed with one million simulations. Denmark went down from 10% to 3% and so on.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO
With 10000 im always very close to one secound. So most of the time i would be at 0.95 but some times i would get to 1s which causes a fee. My choice would be 1000 since the top 5-6 are very close to 10000 and i would never get a fee since im at 0.035s.
