# CS50: Introduction to Computer Science

Welcome to my CS50 repository! This repository contains my completed problem sets from Harvard University's CS50 course. Whether you're a concentrator or just exploring computer science, CS50 offers an exciting journey into the world of programming and problem-solving.

## About CS50

CS50 is Harvard University's introductory course to computer science and the art of programming. It is designed for both concentrators (students majoring in computer science) and non-concentrators, regardless of prior programming experience.

## Course Objectives

- **Problem Solving:** CS50 teaches you how to approach and solve problems, emphasizing correctness, design, and style.

- **Foundations of Computer Science:** The course covers computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, and data structures, providing a strong foundation in computer science principles.

- **Programming Skills:** Beyond specific languages, CS50 teaches fundamental programming concepts, empowering you to learn new languages independently.

## Course Structure

The CS50 course is divided into segments:

1. **C Programming:** Start with the foundational C language, learning about functions, variables, conditionals, loops, and memory management.

2. **Python:** Transition to Python, a higher-level language, with a deeper understanding gained from C.

3. **SQL and Databases:** Explore SQL for data management.

4. **Web Development:** Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create web and mobile applications.

## Final Project

CS50 culminates in a final project, where you can apply what you've learned by creating your own software project.
